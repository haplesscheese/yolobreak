# yolobreak
Yolobreak is an iOS app to automatically install a compatible jailbreak to the system. Using signing software such as Cydia Impactor, you can install the application, select .yolo files (rebranded .txt's containing instructions for exploitation), and run them. Official .yolo files will be provided, but you can also select your own from a webserver by providing a URL. These files will be installed to the app directory and then interpreted by a program within yolobreak. By clicking "jailbreak me!" in the app, you will begin interpretation of the chosen exploit. You have the choice to install Cydia or not, which, if toggled, will run a bonus script to install the Cydia .deb file to your system after jailbreaking.

The idea for yolobreak all began when I was scouring the Internet for a jailbreak that could improve my iPad's life. Sadly, I found no compatible exploits (I had an iPad Mini on iOS 9.3.5), but I did run into a ton of scams. I wanted to create an app that would install legitimate exploits, tried and true for your specific device, organized by myself. Yolobreak was born. Yolobreak's exploitation-reading programming language, yoloish, was then also created for these exploit files, .yolo's.

I will (hopefully) update this repo everyday with new minor releases and project files. The actual repository 'Releases' section is where I will be uploading 'complete' and 'offical' releases. Many releases in the 'yolobreak releases' folder are incomplete and unstable.
