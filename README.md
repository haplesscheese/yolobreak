# yolobreak
An iOS app to recommend and automatically install a compatible jailbreak to the system. Using signing software such as Cydia Impactor, you can install the application, select compatible exploits, and run them. All exploits are packaged in the .yolo extension, and are pieced together in a universal format, based on official exploits.

I will (hopefully) update this repo everyday with new minor releases and project files. The actual repository 'Releases' section is where I will be uploading 'complete' and 'offical' releases. Many releases in the 'yolobreak releases' folder are incomplete and unstable.
