# yolobreak
Yolobreak is an iOS app to automatically install a compatible jailbreak to the system. Using signing software such as Cydia Impactor, you can install the application, select .rtf files (normal rtf files containing formatted code to be inserted into the app), and run them inside yolobreak. Official .rtf will be provided, but you can also select your own from a webserver by providing a URL. These files will be installed to the app directory and then interpreted by a program within yolobreak. By clicking "jailbreak me!" in the app, you will begin interpretation of the chosen exploit. You have the choice to install Cydia or not, which, if toggled, will run a bonus script to restart the app and install the Cydia .deb file to your system after jailbreaking.

The idea for yolobreak all began when I was scouring the Internet for a jailbreak that could improve my iPad's life. Sadly, I found no compatible exploits (I had an iPad Mini on iOS 9.3.5), but I did run into a ton of scams. I wanted to create an app that would install legitimate exploits, tried and true for your specific device, organized by myself. Yolobreak was born.

Here is the progress thus far:

UI: 90%

Provided .rtf scripts: 0%

Exlpoit installer: 10%

Cydia installer: 5%

I will (hopefully) update this repo everyday with new minor releases and project files. The actual repository 'Releases' section is where I will be uploading 'complete' and 'offical' releases. Many releases in the 'yolobreak releases' folder are incomplete and unstable.
